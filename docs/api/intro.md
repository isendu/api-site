# What you can do with APIs?

The **isendu** APIs can be used to integrate all [stores](/docs/api/reference/store) that are currently not natively supported in isendu.

By integrating the APIs, it will be possible to automatically import all orders received from the store into isendu, so that isendu can be used to create shipments and use all shipping automation and conversational commerce tools such as email and whatsapp marketing.

Other APIs will be added in the future to handle other aspects of interaction with **isendu**
