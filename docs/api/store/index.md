:::caution Important
Secret ID key os unique and cannot be regenerated. If you lose this, you will have to create a new integration.

## Second: get a token for your requests

Each request on API server **must** be authenticated through a token JWT released in Oauth2 mode client credential.

    Client->>API Server: Request on /api-store/oauth/token ?
    API Server-->>Client: JWT Token
    Client->>API Server: Request on /api-store/v1/* with Header "Autorization: Bearer {JWT Token}"
    API Server -) Client: Response as Json
```

:::caution Important
Token route is rate limited: best practice **requires** that the same token be used until its expiration time.
